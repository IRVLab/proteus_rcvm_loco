# proteus_rcvm
Implementations of RCVM using the PROTEUS protocol.

The Dead-Guess version is the only currently available RCVM for LoCO. If you ever get a good autopilot running, reimplement with that, using the Aqua autopilot version as a guide.

### This is research code. As much as I would love to be able to develop it until it's extremely stable and easy to use, that's simply not the way that PhDs work. Please do your best to figure out what's going on inside this code, and if you have problems that you can't resolve, submit an issue/email Michael.
